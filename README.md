# NX Fetch

Neofetch for the nintendo switch. Prints system info and switch icon ascii art in the style you would see in neofetch.

Press DPad left / right to change jcon ascii colors. Press L / R to change the selected user at the top (only works if user wasnt preselected with title takeover)

Also credits go to Kipi000 and his project [NSW-Fetch](https://github.com/Kipi000/NSW-Fetch).
